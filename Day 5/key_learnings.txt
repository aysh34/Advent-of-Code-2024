Day 5

PART 1_____
1) You are given some rules that tell how the pages should appear in an update like 12|45 
    - It means page 12 must appear before 45

2) You are given some updates(i.e list of pages) like [74,23,45,12,43,66]

What to do:

1. Check if the pages in each update follow the rules (wether an update is valid or not).
2. Find the middle page of all valid updates.
3. Add the middle pages from all valid updates.

How to check an update:
- First of all, check wether both pages in each rule are present in update. 
- If present:
        First page must appear before than the second one
- If not present:
        Ignore that rule

PART 2_____

For the incorrect updates:
1. Fix the page order using the rules.
2. Find the middle page in the fixed update.
3. Add the middle pages together to get the final answer.
