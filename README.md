# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event in December where participants solve daily programming puzzles. It's a great way to improve your coding skills and have fun with the programming community.

## Structure

Each day's solution is contained within its own directory, named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day01` for December 1st). Inside each directory, you will find:

- `input.txt`: The puzzle input for the day.
- `solution.py` (or other language files): The solution code for the day's puzzle.


## How to Run

To run the solutions, navigate to the respective day's directory and execute the solution file.
