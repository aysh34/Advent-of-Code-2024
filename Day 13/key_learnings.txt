- There are many claw machines.
- There are two buttons A and B.
- Each button moves the claw by specific amount on x axis and y axis.
- pushing these buttons cost tokens (3 for A and 1 for B).
- No button is pressed more than 100 times.

What to do???

- To win the prize align the claw exactly above prize on X and y axis.
- Spend the fewest tokens to win all possible prizes.

For example:
Button A: X+94, Y+34
Button B: X+22, Y+67
Prize: X=8400, Y=5400

When pressed, button A moves the claw 94 units on x axis and 34 on y axis.
When pressed, button B moves the claw 22 units on x axis and 67 on y axis.
The prize is located at (X=8400, Y=5400)

Goal:
How many times to press Button A (a) and Button B (b) such that:
The claw moves exactly 8400 units on the X-axis:
94a+22b=8400
The claw moves exactly 5400 units on the Y-axis:
34a+67b=5400

The combination of a and b that achieves this with the minimum cost:

Cost=3a+1b
